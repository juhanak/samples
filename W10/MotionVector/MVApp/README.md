# MotionVector

This sample app shows how to use FFmpeg library to extract motion vectors from the mpeg video. 

Project contains code from FFmpegInterop library for Windows. Original code is available here: https://github.com/Microsoft/FFmpegInterop

##Prerequisites
Getting a compatible build of FFmpeg is required for this to work. FFmpeg library is as a submodule so taking recursive clone of the project will also clone ffmpeg library. Compiling FFmpeg for Windows is covered here in details: https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/WinRT
